# Dragon Blast
This is a prototype of the R-type game in C language using the Allegro library that i made for a college project at UFMG

## üêâ Description 
the player commands a Dragon, where the objective is to destroy the many enemies as possible, represente by a filled circle with different colors, remembering that the white enemies are immortal. You can use the key "space" to shoot, and there is the single shot, which kills only 1 enemie, and the strongest shot that is activated when the player press the key for 1.5 seconds or more, which destroys all enemies in front. Also, there are the blocks that appear on the screen that are indestructible. Hope u have fun playing :)
